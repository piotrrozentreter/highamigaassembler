# Heap Memory Manager - Implementation Overview

## What's Included

Complete, production-ready heap memory manager for 68000/Amiga systems (current implementation in `lib/heap.s`):

The default heap is `10*1024` bytes in CHIP RAM (`bss_c`). Override it with
`-D HEAP_MEMORY=<bytes>` when assembling `lib/heap.s`, or set `HEAP_MEMORY` when using
`scripts/build_game.sh`; the helper limits that define to the heap library assembly. Keep the
override at or below roughly 128 KiB because block lengths are stored as 16-bit word counts.
The `141312`-byte (138 KiB) value is not currently allocator-safe and should not be enabled for
Jetpac until the allocator metadata is redesigned. Runtime demand and fragmentation can reduce
the practical capacity further.

## Decision: Custom vs. Kickstart

### ✅ Custom Implementation Selected

**Why NOT Kickstart's AllocMem:**
- Requires Exec library initialization
- Complex ABI and exception handling
- Not portable (bare-metal, emulators)
- Overkill for simple allocation patterns
- Dependencies on DOS/Workbench

**Why Custom:**
- Pure 68000 assembly
- No external dependencies
- Works anywhere (bare-metal, emulators, real hardware)
- Transparent & educational
- Easy to customize
- Perfect for High Assembler philosophy

## Architecture at a Glance

### Simple First-Fit Scan (no free list)

```
Allocate(words):
  1. Walk blocks from heap_start
  2. Skip occupied blocks
  3. If first free block fits, split if tail can hold a header; else take whole
  4. Return payload pointer (header + 4)

Free(ptr):
  1. Mark block free
  2. Forward-coalesce with following free blocks
  3. Backward-coalesce by scanning from heap_start to find predecessor
```

### Memory Layout

```
[HEADER][PAYLOAD] [HEADER][PAYLOAD] ... [HEADER=0] ; end marker

Header (4 bytes):
  High word: length in words (payload only)
  Low  word: status (0=free, 1=occupied)
Payload pointer = header + 4
```

## API (current `heap.s`)

1) `HeapInit()` — initialize internal fixed heap (no args)

2) `HeapAlloc(size_words)` — size in words (16-bit units); returns payload ptr or 0

3) `HeapFree(ptr)` — frees if non-null; coalesces forward and backward

## Key Features

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| First-fit scan | ✅ | Linear walk, first free that fits |
| Block coalescing | ✅ | Forward + backward merge |
| Split large blocks | ✅ | If tail can hold a header/end marker |
| Free list | ❌ | Not used; sequential scan |
| Stats call | ❌ | Not present in current heap.s |
| NULL safety | ✅ | `HeapFree(0)` no-op |
| Edge cases | ✅ | Bounds/status checks on free |

## Performance

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| HeapAlloc | O(n) | Linear scan of blocks |
| HeapFree  | O(n) | Forward + backward coalesce (scan for prev) |

**n = number of blocks (free+used) in heap order**

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Include in Your Project

```bash
vasm68000_mot your_program.s lib/heap.s -o output.o
```

### Step 2: Initialize Heap

```asm
jsr HeapInit           ; uses internal BSS heap
```

### Step 3: Allocate / Free

```asm
move.l #256,d0         ; request 256 words (512 bytes)
jsr HeapAlloc
tst.l d0
beq alloc_failed
; ... use d0 ...
jsr HeapFree           ; free the pointer in d0 (or move to a0 then free)
```

## Common Use Cases

### Dynamic Arrays (word-sized requests)
```asm
; Allocate 100 ints (4 bytes each) => 400 bytes => 200 words
move.l #200,d0
jsr HeapAlloc
```

### Linked Lists
```asm
; Allocate node
move.l #16,d0            ; Node size
jsr malloc
move.l d0,node_ptr
```

### String Buffers
```asm
; Allocate 256-byte buffer => 128 words
move.l #128,d0
jsr HeapAlloc
move.l d0,str_ptr
```

### Temporary Scratch Space
```asm
move.l #512,d0          ; 512 words = 1024 bytes
jsr HeapAlloc
move.l d0,work_buffer
; ... use it ...
move.l work_buffer,a0
jsr HeapFree
```

## Integration with High Assembler

### Link Step

```bash
python3 -m hasc.cli myprogram.has -o myprogram.s
vasm68000_mot myprogram.s lib/heap.s -o myprogram.o
vlink myprogram.o -o myprogram.exe
```

### In .has Code

```has
extern func HeapInit();
extern func HeapAlloc(size_words: long) -> ptr;
extern func HeapFree(ptr: ptr);

code myapp:
  proc test_alloc() -> ptr {
    HeapInit();
    var p: ptr = HeapAlloc(128);   ; 256 bytes
    if (p != 0) {
      HeapFree(p);
    }
    return p;
  }
```
